This is my solution to the 2nd problem of the week 4 of the "Data Structure and Algorithm Specialization" offered by the University of California San Diego. 
- - - Binary Search with Duplicates Problem - - -
Find the index of the first occurrence of a key in a sorted array.
Input: A sorted array K = [k0,...,knâˆ’1] possibly with duplicates and an integer q.
Output: Index f the first occurrence of q in the array or "-1" if q does not appear in the array.
