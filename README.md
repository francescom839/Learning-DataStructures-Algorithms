# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice Repository 🚀

## Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms practice repository!

## About ℹ️
This repository serves as a practising ground where I upload some of the files for the Data Structures and Algorithms I use. Here, you'll find various implementations, exercises, and experiments related to algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.

## Contents 📁
- [Divide And Conquer](Divide-And-Conquer/): Algorithms that use the technique "Divide And Conquer" with the Week 4 Assignments of the "Data Structure and Algorithms Specialization" offered by the University of San Diego California 

## Usage 💡
Feel free to explore the contents of this repository. You may find implementations of common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and algorithms like sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.

## Contributing 🤝
If you have suggestions, improvements, or additional implementations you'd like to share, I welcome contributions! Please feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Happy coding! 💻
