# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms practice repository!

## About
This repository serves as a practising ground where I upload some of the files for the Data Structures and Algorithms I use. Here, you'll find various implementations, exercises, and experiments related to algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.

## Contents
- [Folder 1](Divide-And-Conquer/): Algorithms that use the technique "Divide And Conquer".

## Usage
Feel free to explore the contents of this repository. You may find implementations of common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and algorithms like sorting, searching, and dynamic programming. 

## Contributing
If you have suggestions, improvements, or additional implementations you'd like to share, I welcome contributions! Please feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
